# Dataset Description

The data utilized in this study were obtained from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS), a publicly available neuroimaging dataset designed to support research on aging and dementia.

The dataset comprises cross-sectional structural MRI data along with associated demographic and clinical information. MRI scans were acquired using standardized imaging protocols, and derived anatomical measures were used as features in the machine learning analysis.

In addition to imaging-derived attributes, the dataset includes key demographic and neuropsychological variables such as age, gender, education level, socioeconomic status, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores.

All data usage complies with OASIS data-sharing policies. No raw MRI images, extracted feature matrices, or subject-level records are distributed through this repository. The repository provides methodological documentation and analytical context only.
