# Clinical Interpretation

A central objective of this study is to bridge machine learning–based predictions with clinically meaningful interpretation. In this context, the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale plays a pivotal role.

CDR is a widely accepted clinical assessment tool that captures dementia severity across multiple functional domains. Its inclusion as a target variable allows machine learning models to align closely with clinical diagnostic reasoning rather than relying solely on abstract computational patterns.

The results demonstrate that CDR consistently emerges as a strong and stable predictor across a wide range of machine learning classifiers. This finding reinforces the clinical validity of CDR and highlights its robustness as a prognostic indicator independent of algorithmic choice.

An important observation from the comparative analysis is that increased model complexity does not necessarily guarantee superior clinical utility. In several cases, simpler or moderately complex models achieved performance comparable to more advanced approaches when clinically relevant variables were incorporated.

From a clinical perspective, these findings suggest that machine learning models should be viewed as decision-support tools that complement, rather than replace, expert judgment. The integration of standardized clinical scales such as CDR enhances interpretability, trust, and potential translational impact in real-world dementia assessment settings.
